- Frontend: React with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool. Styling with TailwindCSS.
- Backend: Node.js with TypeScript and Express, connected to a PostgreSQL database using Prisma as the ORM.

  > **Note on apps image handling:**
  > The current approach to handling images in this project is not ideal. Images are embedded as base64-strings, which isn't aligned with best practices for performance and scalability. This was a conscious trade-off made to simplify development and keep the project lightweight

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites for running locally:

- Node.js installed
- PostgreSQL installed and running
- PostgreSQL database created and accessible
- `.env` file which has correct `DATABASE_URL` that connects to said database
- `.env` file must also have `SECRET` defined

```env
# Example of DATABASE_URL for PostgreSQL
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/yourdb"

# Example of SECRET for password hashing
SECRET=your-very-secret-key-1234567890
```

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm install
npm run db:init
npm run dev

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Three users (user1, user2, user3) will be seeded to database. They all have properties to control and all have the same password(password).
